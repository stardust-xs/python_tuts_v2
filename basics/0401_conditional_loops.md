# Loops in Python (continued...)

**Note:** To understand **while** loops better, we need to have a basic understanding of conditional loops.

## Conditional Loops

If its name doesn't ring the bell, **[conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_loop)** loop are the loops that are executed for a particular **condition**. They provide a mechanism to perform or execute something if a certain condition is satisfied or **True**.

**Conditional** loops always returns boolean values. Python uses conditional loop using if-else statements. Python being high level language, uses simple natural language words like if and else. These are used for making decisions.
